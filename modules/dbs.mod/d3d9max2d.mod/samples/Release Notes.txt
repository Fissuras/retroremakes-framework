This module implements a DX9 Max2d driver.


The driver is designed to use Fixed Pipleline operations under DX9 so it should work on
any machine that has a valid DX7 device driver with DX9 installed.

Areas that might not work correctly is MIP Mapping as it currently uses in driver based
MIP Mapped generation and I am not checking the CAPs bits to see if its unsupported. 
Feedback in this area would be appreciated.

To use add the DX9Max2dDriver folder to a BMX mod directory and import the driver
and set the GraphicsDriver using the following code fragment
...


Import dbs.d3d9max2d
SetGraphicsDriver D3D9Max2DDriver()

' new feature/option in 0.8
' D3D9GraphicsDriver().DoSyncGPU=FALSE/TRUE  ' true by default so you dont need to do anything or include unless you want to disable


Thanks and please let me know of any problems or issues not rendering correctly or if
you suffer from a crash with a Card you know works with most DirectX9 rendering. 

I have included a Precompile CapsReporting tool.  If you have a card that is misbehaving use this on the
machine with the card that is not working so I can identifiy compatibility issues.

0.2 Dx9Max2dGraphicsDriver
	- revised handling of Pixmap to Texture
0.2 DX9Graphics 
	- fixed issue with _InScene variable when D3DDevice Recreated
	- revised DeleteDevice Object to Queue objects for deletion. Allows delete for object to be called while handling message
0.2 Dx9Max2dGraphicsDriver
	- changed textures management to use DEVICECREATE/DESTROY Message improve alt/tab or display change response
	- fixed issue deletion queue not always purging deleted objects until shutdown
0.3 DX9Graphics 
	- updated to 1.24 fixed issue with order of imports resolving
0.3 Dx9Max2dGraphicsDriver
	- changed to BRL 1.24 Max2d implementation
0.4 DX9Graphics 	
    	- complete rewrite,  better match to brl 1.24 Dx7 driver model to access raw interfaces
    	- usage of swapchains for multiple render targets when using MAXGUI
    	- used swapchain to flip to control VSYNC without reseting devivce
0.4 Dx9Max2dGraphicsDriver
	- updated to new version of Dx9GraphicsDriver
Feb 24,2007
0.5 Dx9Max2dGraphicsDriver
	- revised Driver Message Sink to detach upon DestroyMessage since implies context nonlonger valid
0.5 DX9Graphics 
	-added Cap checking and ablitlty to get caps for current display adapter
Sept 26,2008
0.6 Dx9Max2dGraphicsDriver
	- completely redid rendering pipeline, previous was too tightly coupled to optimal rendering pattern.
March 17,2009
0.7 Dx9Utils.bmx
	- fixed issue with GrabingPixmaps 
April 8, 2009
0.8 Added code to prevent Direct X Draw ahead.  If option does not work across hardware there is code in place to possible 
    enable alternate approach
